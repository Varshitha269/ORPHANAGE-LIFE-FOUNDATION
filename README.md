# Hello!
"Orphanage Life Foundation - a name that encapsulates our mission to create a foundation for a better life for
orphaned children. This is more than just a title; it's a commitment to providing support, spreading love, and fostering
a brighter future. Now, let's delve into the heart of our initiative."

In-view of Techsaksham project, we have designed a website to help the needy. We used HTML, CSS for the front-end
and PHP for the back-end. We also used XAMPP server as our Local Host.
