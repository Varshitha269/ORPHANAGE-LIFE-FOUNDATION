# ORPHANAGE-LIFE-FOUNDATION
TECHSAKSHAM I CAPSTONE PROJECT I EDUNET FOUNDATION I BATCH NO - 13
# Hello!
"Orphanage Life Foundation - a name that encapsulates our mission to create a foundation for a better life for
orphaned children. This is more than just a title; it's a commitment to providing support, spreading love, and fostering
a brighter future. Now, let's delve into the heart of our initiative."

In-view of Techsaksham project, we have designed a website to help the needy. We used HTML, CSS for the front-end
and PHP for the back-end. We also used XAMPP server as our Local Host.


# How to Run the PROJECT?
- Apart from the folders named PPT, REPORT, VIDEO-DEMO-LINK. Store all the remaining folders in a single folder.
- Now The Folder(that has all the project files) must be inside the "htdocs" folder of the XAMPP.
- Now create tables in the XAMPP phpmyadmin according to the forms.
- After running the APACHE and MYSQL, run the project through the localhost:8080
